PoC
===

This repository contains my advisories, proof of concept files and exploits that I have made public and it is located at https://github.com/pedrib/PoC.

You can do whatever you want with these files within the boundaries of the GPLv3 license, which means that:
- you have to include a copy of the GPLv3 license and provide attribution to me as the original author
- you have to disclose the source code of any modifications to the general public
- you have to state any changes you have made to the code

Where parts of the code have been taken from other sources and the license is incompatible with GPLv3, the original license prevails but only for that specific code.
For more information check http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-v3/.

Feel free to send me questions / comments / criticism.
