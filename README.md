PoC
===

This repository contains my advisories, proof of concept files and exploits (referred to as files from now on) that I have made public and it is located at https://github.com/pedrib/PoC.

- Directories:
  - generic: most files
  - vendor/vendor_variant/app/app_variant: vendor specific files (for example ManageEngine, lorexActivex, mw6, etc)
  - msf_modules: Metasploit modules I've made public
  
- Files:
  - tracking.csv: a listing of CVE numbers directly attributed to vulnerabilities I discovered and Metasploit modules I have released
  - LICENSE: GPLv3, see below for more info
  - README.md: this file
  - Some old files containing a message "this file has moved"; this is not to break external links to my advisories

You can do whatever you want with these files within the boundaries of the GPLv3 license, which means that:
- you have to include a copy of the GPLv3 license and provide attribution to me as the original author
- you have to disclose the source code of any modifications to the general public
- you have to state any changes you have made to the code

For code snippets or files that have been taken from other sources and have a license which is incompatible with GPLv3, the original license prevails but only for that specific code snippet or file.
For more information check http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-v3/.

Feel free to send me questions / comments / criticism.
