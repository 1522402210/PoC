PoC
===

This repository contains my advisories, proof of concept files and exploits that I have made public and it is located at https://github.com/pedrib/PoC.
It also contains a CSV file where I keep track of all the vulnerabilities I have discovered (including CVE and other identifiers) as well as all the Metasploit modules I have publicly released.

You can do whatever you want with these files within the boundaries of the GPLv3 license, which means that:
- you have to include a copy of the GPLv3 license and provide attribution to me as the original author
- you have to disclose the source code of any modifications to the general public
- you have to state any changes you have made to the code

For code snippets or files that have been taken from other sources and have a license which is incompatible with GPLv3, the original license prevails.
For more information check http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-v3/.

Feel free to send me questions / comments / criticism.
