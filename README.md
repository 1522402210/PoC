PoC
===

This repository contains my advisories, proof of concept files and exploits (referred to as files from now on) that I have made public and it is located at https://github.com/pedrib/PoC.

- generic: most files
- vendor_name/vendor_name_variant: vendor specific files
- tracking.csv: a listing of CVE numbers directly attributed to vulnerabilities I discovered and Metasploit modules I have released
- LICENSE: GPLv3, see below for more info
- README: this file

Some old files have been kept at the root not to break external links, but they are dummies with a message indicating the file has moved to another directory.

Legal stuff:
You can do whatever you want with these files within the boundaries of the GPLv3 license, which means that:
- you have to include a copy of the GPLv3 license and provide attribution to me as the original author
- you have to disclose the source code of any modifications to the general public
- you have to state any changes you have made to the code

For code snippets or files that have been taken from other sources and have a license which is incompatible with GPLv3, the original license prevails but only for that specific code snippet or file.
For more information check http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-v3/.

Feel free to send me questions / comments / criticism.
