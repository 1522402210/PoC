This repo contains my advisories, proof of concept files and exploits that I have made public.

Note that public does not mean it's in the public domain - everything in this repo is released under the GPLv3 license which means that:
- you have to include this license and provide attribution to me as the original author
- you have to disclose the source code of any modifications to the general public
- you have to state any changes you have made to the code

Where parts of the code have been taken from other sources and the license is incompatible with GPLv3, the original license prevails but only for that specific code.

Feel free to send me questions / comments / criticism.
