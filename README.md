PoC
===

This repository contains my advisories, proof of concept files and exploits that I have made public and it is located at https://github.com/pedrib/PoC.

You can do whatever you want with these files within the boundaries of the GPLv3 license, which means that:
- you have to include a copy of the GPLv3 license and provide attribution to me as the original author
- you have to disclose the source code of any modifications to the general public
- you have to state any changes you have made to the code

For code snippets or files that have been taken from other sources and have a license which is incompatible with GPLv3, the original license prevails but only for that specific code snippet or file.
For more information check http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-v3/.

Feel free to send me questions / comments / criticism.
